          As the virus marched across the United States last year,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/08/business/economy/april-jobs-report.html"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/08/business/economy/april-jobs-report.html">over 20 million jobs</a> vanished in just one month, the worst toll since the Great Depression.
